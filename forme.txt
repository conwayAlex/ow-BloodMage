On average, Unknown Arena fights for the top end of builds take 90-120 seconds, so we can do the math for a 90 second fight. If you want to kill in 2 hemmorhages, you will want it to take around 40 seconds to build up, and then 5 to deal the damage. Over 40 seconds you lose 160% buildup, so you need 260% total buildup ish to proc. Conjure has an 8s cooldown, so each of your casts needs ~43% buildup
