## Additional Comments
I wouldn't consider this mod perfect yet. Damage numbers will need tweaked and there are some bugs I'm sure. I'm hoping I can release it and
have some testing take place so I can get an idea of if anything is broken/OP/needs buffed.

## Feedback
Please direct all feedback, bugs, incompatibilities, etc to Breadcrumb_Lord in the
Blood Mage channel of the Outward Modding Discord. My goal is to keep compatibility with every thing that exists and to
promote synergy between my tree, existing trees, and future trees.
